# PasswordManager
Password Manager application which stores password and other account information encrypted on a local (could go public) server.

I mainly used this to learn more about WPF applications and the MVVM pattern

I do NOT guarantee 100% of safety for anyone wanting to use this. I tried to make everything as secure as possible but there of course is always a risk.
Still it is much better than just storing the data on the pc in plaintext.
